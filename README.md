I’m an AI engineer specializing in backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, and intelligent systems across agentic workflows and financial applications.

I’m also the founder and lead developer of [Cerno AI](https://github.com/cerno-ai), a local-first initiative building open infrastructure for agentic workflows and self-hosted inference systems.

I design modular systems that integrate LLMs into backend services, agent runtimes, and RAG pipelines. I also work across deployment automation, observability, and containerized cloud environments.

I’ve built systems for financial applications, including forecasting models, compliance workflows, and data pipelines, with a focus on performance, auditability, and scale.

Open to opportunities and collaborations in LLM systems, agentic tooling, and cloud-scale infrastructure.

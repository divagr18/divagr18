Iâ€™m an AI engineer specializing in backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, and intelligent systems across agentic workflows and financial applications.

Iâ€™m also the founder and lead developer of [Cerno AI](https://github.com/cerno-ai), a local-first initiative building open infrastructure for agentic workflows and self-hosted inference systems.

I design modular systems that integrate LLMs into backend services, orchestration layers, and RAG pipelines â€” with emphasis on transparency, composability, and verifiability. I also work across deployment automation, observability tooling, and containerized cloud environments.

Iâ€™ve built systems for financial applications â€” including forecasting models, compliance workflows, and data pipelines â€” with a focus on performance, auditability, and scale.

Open to opportunities and collaborations in LLM systems, agentic tooling, and cloud-scale infrastructure.

I’m an AI engineer specializing in backend architecture, cloud infrastructure, and autonomous agent systems.

I design and deploy intelligent software that integrates LLMs into modular backends, distributed orchestration layers, and cloud-native environments — built for transparency, scalability, and operational reliability.

I’m also the founder and lead developer of Cerno AI, a local-first AI infrastructure initiative building open, extensible tooling for LLM-driven automation. Cerno’s ecosystem includes agentic task managers, document RAG interfaces, and orchestration layers that run efficiently on local or self-hosted environments, with optional cloud integrations.

On the backend, I work with modern web frameworks, distributed queues, vector search, and structured APIs.  
On the cloud side, I deploy scalable systems using containerization, CI/CD, and serverless runtimes.

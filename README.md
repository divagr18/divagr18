I’m an AI engineer focused on backend systems, cloud infrastructure, and agentic applications.  

I build intelligent systems that integrate LLMs into scalable backends, distributed orchestration layers, and cloud-native infrastructure - optimized for transparency, modularity, and operational reliability.

I’m the founder and lead developer of [Cerno AI](https://github.com/cerno-ai), a local-first AI infrastructure initiative building open, extensible tooling for LLM-driven automation. Cerno’s ecosystem includes agentic task managers, document RAG interfaces, and orchestration layers that run efficiently on local or self-hosted environments, with optional cloud integrations.

On the backend, I work with modern web frameworks, distributed queues, vector search, and structured APIs.  
On the cloud side, I deploy scalable systems using containerization, CI/CD, and serverless runtimes.

I’m a backend-focused AI engineer building agentic systems, scalable infrastructure, and local-first AI tools. My work centers around LLM–powered systems, with a focus on agent design, tool integration, and training workflows. This includes retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multimodal interaction, distributed task execution, and production-grade deployments - all built with transparency, modularity, and developer control in mind.

## About

- **Founder and Lead Developer** of [Cerno AI](https://github.com/cerno-ai) - a local-first AI infrastructure initiative focused on building open, extensible tools for LLM-driven productivity and automation. Cerno’s ecosystem includes agentic task managers, document-based RAG interfaces, and modular orchestration layers - all designed to run efficiently on personal machines or self-hosted environments, with optional cloud integrations.

- I specialize in building LLM-integrated backend systems with modern web frameworks, task queues, vector search, and scalable cloud deployments using containerization and CI/CD pipelines.
- Focused on designing **autonomous agent infrastructure** that can reason, plan, and act with access to APIs, documents, and local tools - securely and efficiently.
- Interested in transparent, auditable AI; composable workflows; and infra that scales from local machines to distributed clouds.
